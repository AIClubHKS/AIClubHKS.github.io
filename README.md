This theme was forked from [volny](https://github.com/volny)'s [creative-theme-jekyll](https://github.com/volny/creative-theme-jekyll) and adapted to match the club's requirements.

According to its [description](https://github.com/volny/creative-theme-jekyll/blob/master/README.md), it is a jekyll implementation of the [Creative Theme](https://startbootstrap.com/theme/creative) template by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/). Creative is a one page Bootstrap theme for creatives, small businesses, and other multipurpose uses. The theme includes a number of rich features and plugins that you can use as a great boilerplate for your next Jekyll project!
